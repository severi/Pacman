Pacman
======

C++ programming group project done in Autumn 2012. The idea of the project was to create a multiplayer Pacman that could be played with friends online.

External libraries used: SFML

The game itself can be run with no problems and is working fine. The code "under the hood" does contain some minor issues though (enormous main, no references used, etc.)  =)
